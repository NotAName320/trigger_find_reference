# Trigger Finder Reference
A small reference implementation for an algorithm I wrote. Don't know if I'll release the paper to the public yet.

## Running
To run this program, install the requirement in `requirements.txt`.

There are two methods of data generation included: one that sources from the actual NationStates API, and one that mocks data for testing purposes.
